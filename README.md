# HumanChain_AI
HumanChain_AI is a lightweight **Incident Management** REST API built with **Node.js**, **Express**, **MongoDB**, and **TypeScript**.  
It allows administrators to create, view, retrieve, and delete incidents easily through API endpoints.

The API helps to track system incidents efficiently—whether it's a server crash, downtime, or other emergencies.  
Each incident is stored with details like title, description, severity, and report time.

Your task is simple: manage all system incidents in one place using this API!
